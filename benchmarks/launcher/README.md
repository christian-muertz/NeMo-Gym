# Getting Started

On your Slurm cluster with Pyxis/Enroot, put these exports in `benchmarks/launcher/.env`, replacing the placeholders:

```bash
# Slurm
export SBATCH_ACCOUNT="<your-slurm-account>"
export SBATCH_PARTITION="<your-gpu-partition>"
export SBATCH_QOS="<your-gpu-qos>"

# Cluster
export REPLICAS_PER_NODE=4

# Images
export GYM_CONTAINER="/path/to/gym.sqsh"
export ROUTER_CONTAINER="/path/to/vllm-router.sqsh"
export VLLM_CONTAINER="registry-1.docker.io#vllm/vllm-openai:v0.29.0-aarch64"

# Sandbox
export OPENSANDBOX_DOMAIN="http://<your-opensandbox-endpoint>"
export OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY="<your-opensandbox-key>"

# Weight and Biases
export WANDB_API_KEY="<your-wandb-key>"
export WANDB_PROJ="<your-project>"
export WANDB_ENTITY="<your-team-or-user>"
export WANDB_MODE=online
```

`eval.sh` automatically loads the gitignored `.env`; no manual sourcing is needed.
Keep credentials private with `chmod 600 benchmarks/launcher/.env`.
Images can be shared `.sqsh` files or Pyxis registry references (`registry#namespace/image:tag`).

From the Gym repository root, launch TB 2.1 with Laguna S and DFlash:

```bash
bash benchmarks/launcher/eval.sh \
  --profile benchmarks/launcher/laguna/terminal_bench_2_1.sh \
  --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoints/Laguna-S-2.1-FP8
```

Replace `terminal_bench_2_1.sh` with `swe_verified.sh`, `swe_multilingual.sh`,
or `swe_pro.sh` for SWE evaluations. Add `--smoke` for one task and one rollout.
Logs and results go to `runs/<job-id>-<benchmark>/` beside the Gym checkout. Set `RUNS_DIR` to override that location.

# Mounting a Development Gym Checkout

Add this to `benchmarks/launcher/.env`:

```bash
export GYM_DEV_CHECKOUT="/path/to/dev-gym"
```

The checkout must be accessible on compute nodes. It is mounted read-only at
`/mnt/gym-dev` and copied into the container at `/opt/nemo-gym`, excluding runtime
logs, caches, environments and credentials. Installation and evaluation modify only
this private copy. Source edits after startup apply to future jobs; logs and results
still go to the shared run directory.

Set `GYM_INFERENCE_METRICS_ENABLED=true` to scrape vLLM replicas and the router
and publish their counters and gauges through the configured exporters (including W&B).
Router metrics appear under `router/main/`; vLLM metrics remain under `vllm/`.
